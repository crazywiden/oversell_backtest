Please double check your work and what you generated. 
- Is it really complete? 
- Did you approach it from different angles? 

Define first at what angles you can approach it. 
Reiterate on the goal and what it means and what is required to achieve it.
Define what "complete" means in this context.

Proceed with the double check only after you are sure you have done all of the above.

$ARGUMENTS

Your context window will be automatically compacted as it approaches its limit, allowing you to continue working indefinitely from where you left off. Therefore, do not stop tasks early due to token budget concerns. As you approach your token budget limit, save your current progress and state to memory before the context window refreshes. Always be as persistent and autonomous as possible and complete tasks fully, even if the end of your budget is approaching. Never artificially stop any task early regardless of the context remaining.
